  - [#314](../../issues/314) - Hide properties from Snoop?  
    You can now hide properties from Snoop by adding `[System.ComponentModel.BrowsableAttribute(false)]` to your property.  
    It's only shown then if the "Show uncommon properties" is enabled.
  - [#320](../../issues/320) - System resources are not shown in the tree
  - [#326](../../issues/326) - Enable Snoop to show the dev tools of browser controls

  - Support for ARM/ARM64
  - Support for .NET 5 and .NET 6
  - Binding errors are now resolved in an explicit lazy way to prevent it from fixing the error silently.  
    Starting with .NET 5 binding errors are resolved automatically in most cases by using the new `BindingDiagnostics` class from WPF.

## 3.0.0

- ### Bug fixes

  - [#40](../../issues/40) - Message: Cannot set Expression. It is marked as 'NonShareable' and has already been used.

  - Snoop now properly selects the targeted window on startup
  - Snooping multiple app domains now also works for app domains that use shadow copies of assemblies
  - Snooping multiple app domains now also checks for multiple dispatchers in each app domain

- ### Improvements

  - You no longer have to have installed any Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable(s)
  - Added a lot more tracing to the injection process. This tracing can be viewed with [DbgView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview).
  - Because of [#151](../../issues/151) there are now a lot more properties being shown.  
    As a way to reduce the noise a new option to filter uncommom properties was added. The default value for that is `true`, so uncommon properties are hidden by default.  
    If you want to show uncommon properties from types like `Typography` or `NumberSubstitution` etc. just disable the new switch right beside the default value switch.
  - Added "Copy XAML" to the context menu of the property grid. Please note that this feature is not finished and the generated XAML is not very good. I hope to improve this in the future.
